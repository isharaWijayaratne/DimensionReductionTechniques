Three widely used unsupervised dimension reduction techniques have been explored: PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. These methods help in reducing high-dimensional data while preserving essential structures and patterns.

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
PCA is a linear dimension reduction technique that transforms correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated principal components, ranked by their variance. It preserves global structures, making it ideal for capturing the overall trends in data while improving interpretability and computational efficiency.

### t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that maps high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving local relationships. It is particularly effective for visualizing clusters in complex datasets, making it a popular choice for understanding high-dimensional patterns in machine learning applications.

### UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
UMAP is a powerful nonlinear technique that balances local and global structure preservation. It is computationally efficient, scales well to large datasets, and often outperforms t-SNE in maintaining meaningful clusters while providing faster execution times.
